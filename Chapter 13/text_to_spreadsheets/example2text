Write a program that performs the tasks of the previous program in reverse order: the program should open a spreadsheet and write the cells of column A into one text file, the cells of column B into another text file, and so on. 
Write a program to invert the row and column of the cells in the spreadsheet. For example, the value at row 5, column 3 will be at row 3, column 5 (and vice versa). This should be done for all cells in the spreadsheet.
